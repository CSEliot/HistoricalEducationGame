Dear Game Developers,
 
You are getting this because you have either signed up or are considering signing up to create games for educational games pilot. I’m updating the requirements in response to questions many have had. Where these requirements contradict the IC agreement, they supersede what is in the IC agreement. These are to make it easier/more standardized.
 
·        You NO LONGER need to implement a login for a teacher to have them score the game. I will be asking them to score the game offline via a spreadsheet. They will still be scoring for educational value, but now it will be via a spreadsheet I’ll send them rather than in-game. The point of this is to reduce complexity on your side.

·        You still need to have a password to unlock the game once. The game passwords should be as following (depending on the game you are building):

o   Andrew Jackson (the man): apple

o   National Bank: star

o   Nullification: cup

o   Indian Removal: bird

o   Populism: shoe

·        Each student will be given his/her own device for the whole pilot. Use the device MAC address to identify the user in the CSV file. So the student doesn’t need to enter in their name. When I hand out the device to Joe Smith, I’ll write down that Joe Smith has the 98-57-E7-C9-FC-5C device and I’ll write “Joe Smith” on the cover of that device. Then, when I look at the CSV, I’ll see that the MAC address 98-57-E7-C9-FC-5C  rated game A with 5 stars and game B with 3 stars, etc. One of the things to export in your CSV is the MAC address.

·        To help the students find games appropriate to the specific unit, please put a colored border around the icon of the app. Please use the following colors:

o   Andrew Jackson (the man): red

o   National Bank: blue

o   Nullification: yellow

o   Indian Removal: green

o   Populism: black

·        Student rating:

o   Allow the student to rate the game either upon closing the game and upon ending the game. If you feel like this will annoy the student with having them rate too many times, feel free to add a “Don’t ask me to rate again” check box on the rating screen. In your log file that you are using to export the data to CSV, keep track of the ratings. I will use the last rating as the authoritative one.

o   On your rating screen for the student, please use the following standard language (to keep from manipulating students with confusing prompts into rating higher):

§  “Please rate this game on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 stars (highest)” and give them a visual 5 star rating.

o   Since these games will not be in the Apple Store or Google Play store, you can override the home or Back buttons to throw the rating screen up before the user exits.

·        File Export – Create a button on the home screen called “Admin” (it will likely be on the same screen as the “Play game” button, see attached as an example). Pressing the Admin button will throw up a password prompt. The password should be set to “hello”. Entering the correct password will export the CSV file to the SD Card. I will be the one doing this once for each game for each device. Neither the students nor the teachers will have this password. Then I will email out the files to myself from each device. Pressing the admin button with the correct password also re-locks the game (password remains the same, so “cup” for a Nullification game). In summary, pressing the admin button (and entering the proper authentication code) exports the CSV and re-locks the game.

·        CSV file:

o   Use the format GameName.csv

o   Include these in your CSV file (I may add to this in the future, but I’m not going to add anything crazy):

§  Game Name

§  MAC Address

§  Start Session

§  End Session

§  Game Progress (i.e. points scored, levels beaten)

§  Fun Rating from the student

§  Overall game time played

·        Please deliver the game to me through a browser (APK delivery).

 
If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.

Dear Game Developer,
 
You are getting this email because we’ve talked together about developing a microgame for the educational games pilot I’m running. I’m very excited to kick off the project and see what kind of incredibly creative ways you can come up with to teach kids about Jacksonian Democracy!
 
As we discussed, I am hiring you as an independent contractor to design, build and deliver a microgame for one (or more) of 5 microunits in the Jacksonian Democracy unit. I’m attaching several documents to this group of emails (I’m sending in three emails because of the large file sizes):
 
·        Textbook Chapters. This is a scan of the textbook chapters corresponding to the unit on Jacksonian Democracy. The textbook chapters are to show you the reading level the kids are on and the complexity of information being presented. Feel free to use any other resource to educate yourself on the topic via Wikipedia or whatever, this doesn’t have to be your only source of info. The textbook is also referenced and used in the regular teaching materials.

·        Regular Teaching Materials. These are the materials the student typically get and what the “control” group will get (in addition to the textbook). I’ve broken up the material into the microunits. Note that the Common Core standards endorse (and teachers commonly use) primary source documents like political cartoons and newspaper extracts to help the kids learn the information. You are not required to incorporate these into the game but use of primary source materials will likely get you a higher Educational Score from the teacher. Included in the teaching materials is last year’s unit quiz with the relevant microunit’s questions highlighted. The quiz will be modified this year so it’s not exactly the same as last year, but it should give you a good sense of what the final evaluation will be. How the kids do on the evaluation relative to control (those who didn’t play the games) will determine for me whether this pilot is successful or not. A successful pilot means a lot more fun work in the future :-)

 
I’m happy to provide feedback if you have questions or are stuck, but I really just want a great final product and how you get there is up to you. This has never been done before so I can’t tell you what a “good” or “bad” game looks like. Each of you were picked because you do amazing quality work, and that’s all I’m looking for. Please note the deadline is strict so if you can get me something well before the deadline that would be great.
 
Email or call me with questions. You guys are creative rockstars – let’s make some awesome games together!
